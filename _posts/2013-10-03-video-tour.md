### Inspiration

- [Official Drexel Lebow Commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=0tu4qfhi5ps)

- [Drexel Lebow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=mPr3MG5TVkk)
I like this video because it is under 2 minutes, shows what the program will look like without any words, and maintains a fast-paced exciting tempo

- [College of Engineering Promo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=dOdWjSsb9xI) Very well done, compelling, and convincing video. Testimonials from students are honest, hits on the STAR program, freshmen research. Camera-work is very interesting and does an excellent job highlighting cool technology, variety of experiences, and hands-on student work.
