# Conquer CMS

### Prototyping
- [webydo.com](http://webydo.com) is a nice way to quickly generate functional prototypes for design reviews.
- Hey! Checkout the [Conquer Prototype](http://site232406.webydo.com/index.html).

### CMS Decision

So the choice of CMS is going to come down to WordPress or SiteCore. The key factors in this equation are:

- Event support

- Google Maps

- Time / Money

#### Wordpress
**Widgets**

Wordpress has an [upcoming events](http://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/upcoming-events/) widget that allow for events to be displayed and also interfaces with Google Calendar and iCalendar. The widget takes a location, date, summary, and description. Recurring events are not supported. Only the first item in an event will be shown. The workflow is very simple, and no code has to be touched.

**Plugins**

[Event Organiser](http://wordpress.org/plugins/event-organiser/) is a plugin that comes with several nice features like a calendar, iCal sync, and venue map markers. The advantage is that this plug-in allows you to create events that have the same functionality as posts, while adding further features that allow you to manage your events. Checkout the [demo](http://wp-event-organiser.com/demo/)!

#### SiteCore

**Uncertainty**
Site core seems much more rigid, and it is being forced upon us by the university to standardize the top 2 levels of pages. I'm not sure the level of control that I have over these pages and over the functionality of things like an upcoming events feature, a slideshow, or a google maps feature.

### Verdict
I need to find out some more information on Sitecore
