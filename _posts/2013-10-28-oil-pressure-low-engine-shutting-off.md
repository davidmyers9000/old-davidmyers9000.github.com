### The malfunction
Last week I recieved an error that read "Oil Pressure Low, Engine Shutting Off" in <span style="color:red">**BIG RED TEXT**</span> on the dashboard LED, and my vehicle went dead in the middle of the road. While still moving, I guided it off to the shoulder while traffic went past, shifted gear into park, and restarted the engine.

### Consulting the manual
The first thing to do was to check the oil level in the car. After checking, I learned that the engine was bone dry. It turns out that this is **very bad** for the engine. It is a protective mechanism that cuts out the engine, and the manual orders not to restart the vehicle if it shuts down. I violated this warning because I was close to home. had I not been so far away, I may not have risked driving without oil. This can cause serious damage and incur very expensive repairs.

### Contacting the dealiership
Next, the manual recommended to contact the dealership for a checkup. Before doing so I researched my other options.

#### Dealerships
Dealerships will want to add a lot of extra repairs on to what you want to have done, and will make them sound important too. However, they will always ask before performing any repairs and you may always tell them not to do it in interest of saving yourself money. Additionally, many of these things such as [replacing your air filter](#) are easy enough to do yourself, and DIYing will teach you a thing or two about your car as well as keep the cash in your pocket.

#### Independent VW shops
Indie shops will cost less than a dealership for a tune-up. Dealerships can run up to $700 for a checkup and will include everything in the check by default.

The important detail when going with Indie shops is to get the list of services/fixes documented in the bill in order to for the warranty.

#### Warranty
My vehicle's warranty status is 3 years / 36,000 miles. My current mileage is >39,000 so I am officially out of warranty.

Not all parts are covered on the car's warranty, including tires, oil, and most of other maintenance items. 

An important detail is that if you do not maintain your scheduled maintenance, you may be voiding your warranty.
