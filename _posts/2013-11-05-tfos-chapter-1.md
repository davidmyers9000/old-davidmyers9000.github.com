**Plot vs. Story**

The difference between plot and story is that a story contains all of the causal bits laid out from beginning to end. Whereas the plot is the sequence that the events of a story are told in chronological order. Example: *[Memento](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/?ref_=nv_sr_1)*

When talking about stories, how do we differentiate between the size of narrative units, or the pieces of information that make up a story?

**Narrative Structure of Stories**
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/c1u4/diagram-1.png">
- Beats are the smallest part of a story. They are the action and reactions between characters.
- Scenes are conversations etc.
- Sequences
- Acts

Think of Shakespeare

**The 3 usual acts of a story**

**Or more specifically...**

**Typical Movements of a Romantic Comedy**

**Example Analysis: Pretty Woman**

Example Sequence from Pretty Woman
Meeting friend of friend, then she flirts with him innocently, but he knows she is a prostitute and begins to harass her without feeling himself guilty of anything.

Single actions and reactions turn the story a tiny bit each time. Each of these is a beat.

These scenes in which the protagonist interacts with others builds up to a big argument in the following sequence when they are back in the hotel.

**Most stories follow a familiar structure.**

Inciting Incedent > Protagonist > Pursuit of Desire > Climax

- The character's life is thrown out of balance
- He or she decides to pursue something they believe will restore their life's balance
- This could be putting the bad guy in jail, gaining revenge, saving the world from aliens, or obtaining a physical object like Indiana Jones Lost Arc.
- The events of the story, conflicts and struggle progress up to the moment of climax.

**A good story does these 3 things**
- Hook
- Hold
- Pay-off

A good story grabs the audience's attention, drawing them in continuing to hold them on the edge of their seat through progressing the story, and finally satifying them with a BIG finish.

**Arch Plot**

A classical story. Mario over comes obstacles and enemies in the pursuit of a the princess.
Inner and Outer Forces > Nearly getting defeated > Overcome to reach Desire

**Alternatives**

Robert McKee - Screenplay writer
Anti-plot, mini-plot

Even Picasso and Dali first mastered existing rules fist before becoming famous and innovating

Looking at past, present, to build future.

Cornelia Funke

How to get started
NanoWriMo

Start deisng stories, starts with an image, a character who steps into my house who wants me to tell his story. Like you can feel out an touch them. Sometimes its a photo. Have different ideas, keep playfulness, test things out.
You have a moment
Could this really hold my attention for the right amount of time, 2 years?
Story could be surprisingly interesting
Several ideas with a story, main project or could be side project,
Location is a trigger for some people. Can be a hero of the story. it is the canvas to paint on.
For a novel Cornelia reads 50 books each.
Must have playfulness at the beginning. SO IMPORtANT to have.
Old photo albums, fairy tales from that area, plants, treasures, real chacters, inspire own creativity, break your own limits. The richer your story will become.
