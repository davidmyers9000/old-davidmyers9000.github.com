**David Bordwell - Retardation principle**

"Often a mystery in a narrative occurs when the plot withholds important events from our knowledge. [...] delaying the information about [event X] until [person Z] learns of it." - David Bordwell

"Only by delaying the relevation of some information can the plot arouse anticipation, curiosity, suspense, and surprise." - David Bordwell

**Story devices**
