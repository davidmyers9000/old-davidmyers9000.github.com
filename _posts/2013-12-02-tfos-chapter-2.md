One-offs, beginning+biddle+end,

**David Bordwell - Retardation principle**

"Often a mystery in a narrative occurs when the plot withholds important events from our knowledge. [...] delaying the information about [event X] until [person Z] learns of it." - David Bordwell

"Only by delaying the relevation of some information can the plot arouse anticipation, curiosity, suspense, and surprise." - David Bordwell

**Story devices**
- Flashbacks
- Voice-overs

## Unit 2.2 - Weekly formats in serial TV

## Unit 2.3 - Weeklies vs Dailies
Both procedural and serial structures are the dominant form of storytelling on US TV.

another well known weekly tv format on TV is the Half-hour comedy and the Sitcom.
- Full house
- 2 and a hlaf men
- Friends

Apart from the weekly formats Dailies are very important too.

Nearly every country has them

Rebecca Hine
Good times, bad times: Germany's most successful TV show. Access primetime show that has been running for 20 years now.

What is the difference between telling the stories in a Daily format in terms of any other format?

The character. The character has to be adaptive

How do viewers consume? 

What are they like, what do they like?

What does this mean for a character in a Weekly series?
A weekly series the character is adaptive to the plot, moreso than a 90 minute movie.

What specifics of character design do we find specific to Dailies?
- Dailies are an "evening snack"
- Not overly complex
- average viewer only watches 3 of 5 episodes a week
- simplifying
- many characters ~25
- Kill characters or send them to New Zealand

The longer the show has been running, the more important it is to tell the audience what is going on.

Tools
- flashbacks
- "The ear" - The plot is revealed in dialogue to someone 
	- Can't tell the story the same way every week

Telenovela
- usually tell the story of a poor and mistreated woman who works her way up through many struggles to meet and marry the handsome rich guy

A Telenovela will have a definite ending whereas a Soap is infinite in length

## Unit 4.1 - Production process - Des Doyle

Production processes vary 

Show Runner - person or persons responsible for all of the production. Like a captain on the ship. Steering towards the "safe harbor" of Renewal, rather than crashing against the rocks of cancellation.

James Duff - takes 45 minutes to walk down the hall. Answering questions from everybody.

misconception - little time spent writing, more time in production.

What do you think the key is to US TV that makes it so entertaining and captivating?

Indoctrinated is a strong word, but US audiences are so educated and TV are available. US TV also was born and invented in the US.

**Writer's room**

Pick a serial protagonist that you know very well, and create a character profile that includes their most important traits, that captures your attention, makes you pay attention to them.

Compare those traits to the profles to other protagonists, how they work, why they were designed, why some work better than others? And have fun.
