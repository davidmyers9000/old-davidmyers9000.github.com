### Why is it Important?

- avoid expensive law suits
- 20% of the internet goers have some disability
- To be readable by disabled viewers, information on the internet must be properly marked up and formatted.
- Drexel Biomed should create solutions for the disabled...not problems!

### How to Avoid Bad Powerpoints
Any powerpoint can easily be improved by reading the [7 steps to an accessible powerpoint slideshow guide](http://www.dor.ca.gov/DisabilityAccessInfo/DAS-Docs/7-Steps-2-Create-Accessible-PowerPoint-Slideshow.pdf).

#### Before Creating a New PowerPoint
- [Use the outliner](#)
- Do not embed text into images
- Avoid using textboxes galore.
	- TextBoxes are **bad**
		- Not always read by screen readers
		- Not always read in the correct order 
- Images should have alt text
- Videos should be captioned

#### For Existing PowerPoints
- The easiest solution is to use the [Accessibility Checker](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/redir/HA010369192.aspx?CTT=5&origin=HA102478227)
- Save your file as a _tagged PDF_ by following these steps:
	- [PowerPoint 2013](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/create-accessible-pdfs-HA102478227.aspx)
	- [PowerPoint 2010](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/create-accessible-pdfs-HA102478227.aspx)
	- [PowerPoint 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/create-accessible-pdfs-HA102478227.aspx)

- Tagging your powerpoint file will add a layer of specific instructions for screen readers so it reads in the proper order.

- PDFs are always prefferable to PowerPoint files, or static image slideshows
