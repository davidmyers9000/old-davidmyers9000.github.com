I discovered that Jekyll has some people building themes for it.

#### From Designer [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com)
**[HIPSTR](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/)**
	A clean minimalistic theme for the indie blogger. Take a look at the tags and posts pages!

**[So Simple](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/)**
	Another clean, beautiful theme that is typography-centric in design. Includes some minimalistic animations to jazz up the user-experience.

**[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)**
	Yet another clean simple layout.

**[JekyllThemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/)**
	Includes some of the themes above and some other good looking ones!
